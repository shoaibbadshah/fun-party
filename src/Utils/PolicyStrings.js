11. Indemnification
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Share Slate, our parent companies, subsidiaries, licensors, service providers, and our and their affiliates, and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners, and employees (individually and collectively, the “Share Slate Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses, or costs(“Claims”) arising out of or related to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your User Content or Feedback; (c) your violation of these Terms or the Community Guidelines; (d) your violation, misappropriation, or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); or (e) your conduct in connection with the Services.

You also agree that the Share Slate Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at Share Slate’s sole option, of any third-party Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and Share Slate or the other Share Slate Parties.

12. Disclaimers
Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. Except as otherwise provided in a writing by us, our Services and any content therein are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, Share Slate does not represent or warrant that our Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. While Share Slate attempts to make your use of our Services and any content therein safe, we cannot and do not represent or warrant that our Services or servers are free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Services.

13. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Share Slate and the other Share Slate Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability-whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise-for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages, or lost profits, even if Share Slate or the other Share Slate Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Without limiting the foregoing, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Share Slate will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by a distributed denial-of-service attack, viruses, or other technologically harmful material that may infect your computer, mobile device, equipment, computer programs, data, or other proprietary material due to your use of Share Slate or the Services, or items obtained through Share Slate or the Services, or due to your downloading of any material posted on Share Slate or any website or application linked to it.

The total liability of Share Slate and the other Share Slate Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the greater of $25.00 or the amount paid by you to use our Services.

The limitations set forth in this Section 13 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud, or intentional misconduct of Share Slate or the other Share Slate Parties, or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

14. Release
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Share Slate and the other Share Slate Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”

15. Transfer and Processing Data
In order for Share Slate to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer, and store information about you in the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.

16. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration
Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Share Slate and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

No Representative Actions. You and Share Slate agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Share Slate and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.

Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or Share Slate seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Share Slate seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Share Slate waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Share Slate or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Share Slate and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim ( “Notice”) to Share Slate by email at contact@shareslate.fun. The Notice must: (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Share Slate cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Jose, California or may be conducted telephonically or via video conference for disputes alleging damages less than $5,000, unless you are a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). For purposes of this Section, you will be deemed a “consumer” if you use the Services for your personal, family, or household purposes. The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

You and Share Slate agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

The arbitrator, Share Slate, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

You and Share Slate agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Share Slate will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Share Slate, Share Slate will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Share Slate agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Joaquin County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Share Slate will not have the right to assert the claim.

You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 16 by emailing contact@shareslate.fun. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 17.

If any portion of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 16 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 16; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 16 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 16 will be enforceable.

17. Governing Law and Venue
Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Joaquin County, California.

18. Modifying and Terminating our Services
We reserve the right to modify our Services or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of our Services at any time. You also have the right to stop using our Services at any time. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.

19. Severability
If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

20. Miscellaneous
The failure of Share Slate to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.`,
